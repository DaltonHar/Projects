    <div class="indented"><p> My name is Dalton Harris, I am 23 years old and I am currently working as an internet repair agent at Spectrum. 
        In my free time I usually play video games or Magic the Gathering (MTG) with my wife. Some of my favorite video games, in no
        particular order, are:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Apex Legends</li>
            <li>Skyrim</li>
            <li>Skul: The Hero Slayer</li>
            <li>Hollow Knight</li>
            <li>Risk of Rain 2</li>
        </ul>
        On top of being a nerd who plays video games and MTG, I am a cat person. I have two male orange tabbies.

        <br>
        <div class="indented">This is my first cat who was picked up his last day at the pound. My wife and I made the impulsive decision to pick him up and
        bring him home. He likes to sleep on the end of our recliner while we sit down, or if he wants attention he jumps on the back
        the TV and gives us a heart attack.</div>
        <h2 class="shad">Cole</h2>
        <img src="img/cole2.jpg" alt="My Second Orange Cat" height="250px" width="200px">
        <img src="img/cole.JPG" alt="My Second Orange Cat Again" height="250px" width="200px">
        <br>
        <div class="indented">This is my newest cat, Cole. He was found stuck in a tree and no I didn't call a fire department to get him down. He is 
        estimated to be about 4-6 months old. He and Reynolds weren't very good friends at first. Lots of hissing and growling
        over territory, but after only a few weeks Cole and Reynolds play together nicely, unless they are secretly out to get
        each other.</div>
        <br>
        <h2 class="shad">How did I get here?</h2>
        <div class="indented">I was never a fan of college right out of high school. I went to a local community college on and off for 2 years (completing
        two semesters) and finally realizing that I just couldn't do it, at least not right after highschool. I decided to try <a  href="
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_coder">Medical Coding</a> after working at restaurants, mowing yards, and working at
        a daycare. To get certified to be a medical coder I needed to receive a CPC (certified professional coder) which I was able
        to do after completing an 8-month long online course. Once I received the certification, I began looking for a job that would
        help me get my foot in the door. Unluckily, I didn't find any, so I applied and was accepted to work at Spectrum. I have always
        been a good "people-person" and have enjoyed troubleshooting and/or solving problems, so I decided to try it. While working
        as an Internet Repair agent at Spectrum, I have still been interested in coding itself. That brings me to where I am now,
        but I will go into more detail as to <em>why</em> I began coding <a href="./why_code.html">here</a>.</div>

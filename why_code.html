          <p class="indented">
            So, you really wanna know why I started coding? Well, I think it's just <em>because</em>. 
            <br>
            I honestly don't know why exactly I wanted to start. A list of reasons I can think of that might be why are:
            <ol>
                <li>My friends are doing it</li>
                <li>Further and/or change my career</li>
                <li>Improve myself</li>
                <li>It's something different</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="indented">But I will know for sure why I'm coding in the near future. I don't know exactly where it will take me <em>in</em> the near
            future, but part of me is hoping to change my career and veer away from jobs that require direct contact with customers.</div>
            <h2 class="shad">My Favorite Thing about Learning Coding</h2>
            <div class="indented">My favorite thing thus far would definitely be seeing my improvement overall after only a week of learning HTML and CSS.
            Creating this website by myself I know will be my greatest achievement and one of the biggest steps I have taken in learning
            coding, since I began.</div>
